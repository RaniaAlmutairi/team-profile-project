# Team Profile Project

## What this project does:
This is a simple HTML/CSS project to showcase team members using Git version control.

## What Git concepts I learned:
- Initializing repositories
- Creating and switching branches
- Committing changes
- Merging branches and resolving conflicts
- Undoing changes using Git commands
- Working with remote repositories on GitHub

## Most useful Git commands:
- git checkout -b
- git add / git commit
- git merge
- git reset
- git push / git pull

## Challenges:
Understanding how merge conflicts work and resolving them manually.
